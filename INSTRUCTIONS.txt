Absolutely—here’s a ready-to-use, copy-paste Cursor / AppCursor prompt that will get it to build a Python analysis app for your SurveyCTO export. It assumes you’ll provide:
* a raw survey export CSV (column headers = name from the survey)

* a questions CSV with at least columns: type, name, label (optional analysis/note)

* optionally, a choices CSV with columns like list_name, name (choice code), label (choice text). If you don’t have this now, the app should still work using codes.

It outputs per-question analyses in top-to-bottom survey order, with the exact visuals/statistics you asked for.

Prompt for Cursor (paste this in one go)
You are building a small Python app that analyzes SurveyCTO data. Deliver a clean, self-contained solution that runs locally with streamlit run app.py.
Goal
Given:
   1. a survey data CSV (raw SurveyCTO export; headers are question names),

   2. a questions CSV with columns: type, name, label (optional analysis, note),

   3. (optional) a choices CSV with columns: list_name, name, label,

render a per-question report in the same order as the questions CSV. For each question type, do:
      * Integer / Decimal (numeric):

         * Show mean, median, mode (if no exact mode exists, state “no single repeated value; showing modal bin”).

         * Plot a bar-like histogram with sensible cutoffs using the Freedman–Diaconis rule for bin width, capped at 30 bins. Axis labels and counts must be clear.

            * Select-one:

               * Show raw % distribution among non-missing responses.

               * Plot a pie chart with labels. If a choices CSV is present, map codes → labels; otherwise show codes.

                  * Select-multiple:

                     * SurveyCTO stores these as space-separated codes (e.g., "a b d").

                     * For each option, compute % of respondents who selected that option using denominator = non-missing responses for that question.

                     * Show a bar chart with y-axis 0–100%.

                     * If a choices CSV is present, map codes → labels; otherwise show codes.

                        * Text:

                           * Show a written list of all answers (verbatim), in question order.

                           * For long lists, display the first 200 in the UI and offer a download of the full list as CSV.

General:
                              * Treat empty strings, "NA", "N/A", "na", and blank cells as missing.

                              * Use questions.csv order to control top→bottom rendering. Skip items without a matching data column.

                              * Handle SurveyCTO type values like integer, decimal, text, select_one X, select_multiple Y. You may also encounter begin group, end group, note, etc.—skip non-question types.

                              * If choices.csv is missing, still analyze counts using the raw codes.

                              * All percentages should be rounded to 1 decimal place.

                              * All charts must have clear titles using the question label (fallback to name if label missing).

                              * Provide a sidebar uploader for the three CSVs and a download section for machine-readable outputs (CSV): per-question summaries for numeric stats, select-one %, select-multiple %, and text answers.

Tech & UX
                                 * Python ≥3.10

                                 * streamlit, pandas, numpy, plotly.express (for charts), scipy (for stats if needed)

                                 * One file app.py. Keep code modular with helper functions.

                                 * Clean, minimal UI: left sidebar for file uploads and options; main pane lists questions in order with compact cards.

                                 * Include a toggle to exclude “Don’t know/Refuse/Other” labels from pie/bar charts (default: included). If excluded, show a footnote with what was removed.

                                 * Provide a small Data dictionary tab: show detected questions, inferred type, #non-missing, and whether choices mapping was found.

Edge cases
                                    * Mode for continuous data: if no repeated values, report “no exact mode” and instead display the modal bin midpoint and width.

                                    * Select-multiple empty (all missing): show a friendly “No responses” message.

                                    * Unexpected types: display “Type not supported” but keep the app running.

                                    * Choice mapping mismatch: if some codes are missing from choices, show the code as-is and add a warning line under the chart.

Output format details
                                       * Numeric summary table columns: question_name, label, n_nonmissing, mean, median, mode_value (or modal_bin), sd, min, p25, p75, max.

                                       * Select-one summary: question_name, label, choice_code, choice_label, count, percent.

                                       * Select-multiple summary: question_name, label, choice_code, choice_label, selected_count, selected_percent.

                                       * Text answers export: question_name, label, response (one row per answer).

                                       * Provide download buttons for each export.

Implementation sketch (follow this structure)
                                          1. Sidebar:

                                             * Uploaders for: survey_data.csv, questions.csv, (optional) choices.csv.

                                             * Checkbox: “Exclude DK/Refuse/Other” (default off). If on, drop rows whose choice_label matches regex like (?i)\b(don'?t know|refuse|other|unsure)\b.

                                                2. Load & normalize:

                                                   * Read CSVs with dtype=str. Strip whitespace from headers and values.

                                                   * Normalize missing to NaN.

                                                   * Parse questions.type to infer category:

                                                      * numeric if type in {integer, decimal}.

                                                      * select_one if startswith select_one.

                                                      * select_multiple if startswith select_multiple.

                                                      * text if equals text.

                                                         * For select types, extract list_name (the token after the space).

                                                            3. Choice map:

                                                               * If choices.csv is supplied, build choices_map[list_name][code] = label.

                                                                  4. Per-question render (loop over questions.csv order):

                                                                     * Skip non-question types (e.g., groups, notes).

                                                                     * If name not in survey columns, display a subtle warning card and continue.

                                                                     * numeric:

                                                                        * Coerce to numeric with pd.to_numeric(errors="coerce").

                                                                        * Compute stats; Freedman–Diaconis for bins (cap 30).

                                                                        * Plot histogram via plotly.express.histogram.

                                                                           * select_one:

                                                                              * Count non-missing; normalize to percent.

                                                                              * Map labels via choices_map if present.

                                                                              * Pie chart with percentages and labels.

                                                                                 * select_multiple:

                                                                                    * Split responses by whitespace into exploded long format.

                                                                                    * Count by option; compute percent over respondents with any non-missing for that question.

                                                                                    * Map labels if available.

                                                                                    * Bar chart with y-axis formatted 0–100%.
